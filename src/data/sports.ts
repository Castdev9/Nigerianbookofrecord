    biography:
      'Sunday Ogochukwu Oliseh was the cerebral tactical linchpin of Nigeria\'s midfield for over a decade. Possessing immaculate passing range, positional awareness, and a fearsome long-range shot, Oliseh anchored the engine room at Atlanta 1996, playing every minute of Nigeria\'s tournament run. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, he scored one of football\'s most iconic World Cup goals—a 25-yard thunderbolt against Spain that secured a 3–2 upset. His club career took him to European giants including Ajax (winning the Dutch double), Juventus, and Borussia Dortmund (winning the German Bundesliga in 2002).',
